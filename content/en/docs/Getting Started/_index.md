# Getting Started with GetSMart Token

Welcome to the GetSMart Token project! This guide will help you get started with our blockchain-based digital badge system on the Polygon network.

## Project Overview

GetSMart Token is a decentralized platform that allows users to be either sponsors or achievers. Sponsors can create and award digital badges, while achievers can earn and showcase their achievements.

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Clone the GetSMart Token repository
3. Install project dependencies
4. Set up a local blockchain environment (e.g., Hardhat or Ganache)

## Connecting to Polygon Network

1. Obtain Polygon (MATIC) tokens for gas fees
2. Configure your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to connect to Polygon network
3. Set up your project to interact with Polygon's RPC endpoints

## Next Steps

- Explore the [User Roles](/user-roles) section to learn about sponsor and achiever accounts
- Check out the [Badge System](/badge-system) to understand how to create and award digital badges
- Review the [Blockchain Integration](/blockchain-integration) guide for smart contract development
