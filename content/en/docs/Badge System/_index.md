# Badge System

Our platform utilizes NFTs on the Polygon network to create a robust and verifiable badge system for recognizing user achievements.

## Key Features

1. **NFT Badges**: Each badge is a unique NFT, ensuring authenticity and ownership.
2. **Customizable Criteria**: Sponsors can set specific achievement standards for each badge.
3. **Automatic Issuance**: Badges are minted and awarded automatically upon meeting criteria.
4. **Blockchain Verification**: All badges are verifiable on the Polygon network.
5. **Gamification of Achievement**: Support for a sponsor-created arbitrary hierarchy of levels of badges (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold).

## Token Requirements and Transactions

- A minimum of 1 GETS token is required to create a badge. This token will be transferred to the earner upon badge issuance.
- Using a custom image or media file in a badge requires a minimum of 10 GETS tokens.
- Transaction fees (Gwei) on the Polygon blockchain are typically less than $0.001 MATIC for GETS tokens.
- The badge issuance process involves four separate transactions recorded on the blockchain, validating the certificate and ensuring its authenticity.

## Badge Creation Process

1. Sponsors design badge artwork and metadata.
2. Achievement criteria are defined and implemented.
3. Smart contract is deployed for the badge on Polygon.
4. Badge is made available for earning on the platform.

## User Experience

- Users can view available badges and their requirements.
- Progress towards badge achievements is tracked in real-time.
- Earned badges are displayed in the user's profile and can be shared externally.

## Important Considerations

- Ensure sufficient GETS tokens are available before creating or issuing badges.
- Understand the token requirements and transaction fees to manage resources effectively.
- Always verify badge details before issuance, as blockchain transactions are irreversible.

The Badge System forms the core of our achievement recognition platform, leveraging blockchain technology to create lasting, verifiable records of user accomplishments while ensuring efficient use of GETS tokens and transparent transaction processes.
