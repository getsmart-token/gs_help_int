# Testing Getsmart Token

This document outlines the testing procedures and best practices for the Getsmart Token system. Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the reliability, security, and performance of our platform.

## Types of Testing

### 1. Unit Testing

Unit tests focus on individual components or functions of the system. All developers should write unit tests for new code and update existing tests when modifying functionality.

- Use Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript components
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage

### 2. Integration Testing

Integration tests verify that different parts of the system work correctly together.

- Test API endpoints using Postman or similar tools
- Verify database interactions
- Check third-party integrations

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests simulate real user scenarios to ensure the entire system functions as expected.

- Use Cypress for web application E2E tests
- Test critical user journeys (e.g., token minting, transfers, badge issuance)

### 4. Performance Testing

Regular performance testing helps identify bottlenecks and ensure the system can handle expected loads.

- Use JMeter or Gatling for load testing
- Test API response times under various conditions
- Verify database query performance

### 5. Security Testing

Security testing is vital to protect user data and maintain the integrity of the token system.

- Conduct regular vulnerability scans
- Perform penetration testing at least quarterly
- Use static code analysis tools to identify potential security issues

## Testing Environments

1. **Development**: For individual developer testing
2. **Staging**: For integration testing and UAT
3. **Production**: Live environment

Ensure all tests pass in both Development and Staging before deploying to Production.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

We use GitHub Actions for our CI/CD pipeline:

- All pull requests trigger unit and integration tests
- Merges to the main branch trigger E2E tests
- Successful E2E tests on main lead to automatic deployment to Staging

## Bug Reporting and Tracking

- Use JIRA for bug tracking
- Include detailed steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, and relevant logs
- Assign appropriate severity and priority levels

## Test Data Management

- Use seeded data for consistent test results
- Never use production data in non-production environments
- Regularly refresh test data to cover new scenarios

## Accessibility Testing

Ensure our web interfaces meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards:

- Use automated tools like axe-core
- Conduct manual testing with screen readers

## Regression Testing

Perform regression testing before each major release:

- Focus on core functionality and previously reported issues
- Automate common regression scenarios where possible

## Documentation

- Keep test plans and cases up-to-date in the internal [Help documentation (this site)](/docs/)
- Document all testing procedures and tools
- Maintain a changelog of test suite modifications

Remember, thorough testing is key to delivering a reliable and secure token system. If you have any questions about testing procedures, please contact the QA team lead.
