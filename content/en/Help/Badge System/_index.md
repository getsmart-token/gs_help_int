# Badge System

Our platform utilizes NFTs on the Polygon network to create a robust and verifiable badge system for recognizing user achievements.

## Key Features

1. **NFT Badges**: Each badge is a unique NFT, ensuring authenticity and ownership.

2. **Customizable Criteria**: Sponsors can set specific achievement standards for each badge.

3. **Automatic Issuance**: Badges are minted and awarded automatically upon meeting criteria.

4. **Blockchain Verification**: All badges are verifiable on the Polygon network.

5. **Gamification of Achievement**: Support for a sponsor-created arbitrary hierarchy of levels of badges (e.g., Bronze, Silver, Gold).

## Badge Creation Process

1. Sponsors design badge artwork and metadata.
2. Achievement criteria are defined and implemented.
3. Smart contract is deployed for the badge on Polygon.
4. Badge is made available for earning on the platform.

## User Experience

- Users can view available badges and their requirements.
- Progress towards badge achievements is tracked in real-time.
- Earned badges are displayed in the user's profile and can be shared externally.

The Badge System forms the core of our achievement recognition platform, leveraging blockchain technology to create lasting, verifiable records of user accomplishments.
